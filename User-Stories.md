* As a Ferguson resident who doesn't have home internet access but needs to access social services online, I want to be able to quickly access the sites I need from a library computer's homepage.

* As a local library user, I want to quickly find information about facilities, hours, and available equipment so that I can more efficiently use the library.

* As a remote user (resident sitting at home), I want to be able to check if a book is in so that I can reserve it or travel to pick it up without wasting time.

* As a senior/kid/teen library user, I want to find suggested titles and media for people in my demographic.

* As a civically engaged community member, I want to be able to look at links to local resources so that I'll know what's happening in my town.

*?Maybe?* As library staff, I want to be able to quickly update the site via tweet when rapid changes in services or events happen?
